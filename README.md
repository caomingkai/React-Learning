 # React Learning Demos 

 ## 0. Before diving into project
 - In <head>, we needs 3 <script> in order to use React, that is, "react.js","react-dom.js","browser.min.js"
 - In <body> where we manipulate JSX, we use a special <script type="text/babel" >, whose typel is "text/babel"

 ## 1. After finishing project
 In order to make faster rendering at client-side, use " $ babel src --out-dir build ", parsing all JSX file at directory 'src' into javascript files at directory 'build', where browser could recognize.

 ## 2. ReactDOM.render();
 It is a basic method:
 - converting JSX into HTML;
 - inserting HTML at specified DOM point
